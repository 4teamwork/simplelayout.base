simplelayout.base Installation
==========================

if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``simplelayout.base`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        simplelayout.base
        
  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        simplelayout.base
        
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout


Simplelayout will install all necessary dependencies


You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
